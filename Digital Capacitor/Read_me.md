The final testing is end, and the circuit behavior is eventually following the analog output. 

## Stage 1
Original design.(has been deleted)

## Stage 2
Circuit Validation test, problem solving, and initial ideas for some design change. (has been deleted)

## Stage 3
Fuk'ya you dumb BJT, you piece of crap and sh@t my whole day to desolder.fk ya BJT I kill your mom.
* (finishing testing and more ideas on modifying the board design.) 
* Code has been in the folder. 

### Competing with being "nothing". 
> Some problems has been excountered. 
* Ground has been exposed outside the board, causing fatal short that penetrated the FKBJT.
* IN and OUT ports for Voltage stablizer and amplifier are not standardized designs.
* Charging, discharging, and detecing circuits' width is not enough.
* BJTs is very stupid that easy to die in front of me. 
* Detecing circuit is not functioning. 
* Spacing arrangement of the circuit can be improved. 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

> Improvement that can be done
* IN and OUT ports for Voltage stablizer and amplifier, VCC, Capacitors, and Motor connectors should change to [XT60 series connector](https://www.amazon.com/OOOUSE-XT60-Connector-Pairs-pairs/dp/B005FAPYXS) for better design integration.  
* All the BJTs should switch to MOSFETs for reliability. 
* All the circuit should have lower power LEDs for indicating the circuits' validation and decent labels for each funtionality. 
* Detecting circuit must be modified. 
* The board can be larger for better spacing arrangement and larger trace width. 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

> Next Stage
* New design
* New Programs values.
